# Analysis of Traffic Accidents
This project looks at traffic accident data from Nigeria between 2020 and 2024. The analysis looks to uncover trends in traffic accidents throughout various regions of the country, 
as well as the underlying factors. I will use numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn to achieve this. 

Included in this repository are the Jupyter Notebook file containing the python code and analysis, as well as the CSV file containing the data.
