# Premier League 2023/2024 Player Analysis
I started this data analysis project to highlight my Python skills and my passion for business intelligence and data analysis. As an avid football fan, I wanted to uncover
some insights into player performance this past season. This analysis is done using Jupyter notebooks and the libraries used are numpy, pandas, seaborn, and matplotplib.

The data for this project was retreived from kaggle and I will upload the CSV files used.
